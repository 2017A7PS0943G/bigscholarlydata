}
Values of id MUST be from dblp_pub_se.id. Values of cited_id should be from dblp_pub_se.id. In some cases it can be a special value 0. 
A tuple <id, citedId> in citationxref implies that the paper referenced by <id> cites another paper referenced by <cited_id>. If the cited paper is not in the dblp database, the value should be 0.

For each paper p in dblp_pub_se do {
Get the id, doi for p
Crawl to get the list of references R using the doi. 
For each reference r do {
 get the doi of r and search dblp_pub_ref table with this doi.
 if the record exists {
    cited_id <- r.id
    insert a record <p.id, cited_id, null> in citationxref
 }
 else {
    text = doi;
    insert a record <p.id, 0, text> in citationxref;
